    not getting tagged
    is the most important thing
    not taggining others

    finding others next,
    which supports most important,
    not tagging others

    playzone management,
    the bane of of us newbies
    is next on the list

    then loot management
    a problem if it distracts
     from managing zones

    finally and last
    is shooting other players
    but it's the most fun.
